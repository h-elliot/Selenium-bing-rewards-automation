## NOTE:  
Wrote this for selenium educational purposes.  

## Information: 
Bing gives 5 points for each search made and allows only 150 points from PC Search a day. So here, we are automating bing search with 30 random words. So run the script only **once** a day.  

## Prerequisites:  
1. Download Selenium from [here](http://www.seleniumhq.org/).  
2. Download WebDriver for Microsoft Edge browser from [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/).  
3. Have Python 2.7 installed in your system. If you are using Python 3, run *microsoftrewards_py3.py*  
4. Make sure to have loggedin to your microsoft account in edge and **close the browser**. Script will throw error if a Edge window is already opened.  

## Run:  
1) Add Edge WebDriver directory to System Environment Variables classpath.  
2) Run as ```cmd> python microsoftrewards.py```
